We specifically concentrate on image representation learning for Visual Search and the development of robust image classification models. Presently, our research is focused on the integration of multiple modalities into our models. This integration enables our models to process not only images but also harness diverse sources of information such as product titles, descriptions, and attributes. The implementation of these multimodal models holds significant potential in various domains, including semantic search and the enhancement of product catalog quality. By employing such models, we aim to deliver superior solutions in these areas, ultimately providing enhanced user experiences."

We strive to inspire users and connect them with relevant offers by leveraging recommender systems. To achieve this, we rely on the collective behaviors of our user-base, forming the foundation of our algorithms. However, we also incorporate content features of the items into our models, enriching recommendations with exploratory algorithms. These algorithms not only utilize historical data but also actively engage with the world, enabling us to explore new possibilities. Our major challenges revolve around developing innovative algorithms that can deliver high-quality recommendations while effectively handling Allegro's significant daily traffic. This ambitious endeavor requires us to operate at scale, ensuring seamless user experiences across the platform."
